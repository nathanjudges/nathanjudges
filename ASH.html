            outline the core issues pertinent to Sydney-siders in 2018. through our research the team discovered a re-occuring catalyst for a myriad of problems - Domestic Violence (DV) and so we decided to focus or energy here.<br><br><strong>Solution</strong>:
            After focusing on how autonomy could best help those most affected by DV we came up with a concept that combined a mobile app with an in-car interface that would provide the user with the skills and resources they needed to gain access to
            help and most importantly protect them and their anonymity.<br><br><br></p>
        <p class="text-justify sentences" id="project-sentence-2">After deciding on a problem space we began our first hand research by triangualing the major stakeholders within this topic; Police, Housing Officials and Social Workers. The aim of our research was to&nbsp;determine the major issues within the
            systems set-up to improve the lives of DV sufferers, in both the government and private sectors. In doing this we hoped to learn about the major pain points within this process and assess where we could be most effective in designing a component
            of the solution.<br><br>We utilised; Open-Ended Interviews, Contextual Mapping and Analysis when ingaging with particpants in their place of work. I interviewed police officers and detectives that are heavily involved in the DV unit and the
            Sergeant in charge of the unit.<br><br>Once this data was collected and synthesised the team began amalgamating all the knowledge we had gained and began to form a deeper understanding of the space.<br><br></p>

        <p class="text-justify sentences" id="project-sentence">We struggled to initiate concepts from the information that we had gained and so we went back to the basics and looked up excercises from <em>Design Think Make Break Repeat</em> (Tomitsch et al, 2017). We began by generating a list of all the
            vehicles we could think of and then trialing fprced assosciations to generate over 60 ideas, which we then solidified by turning them into XYZ statements.<br>Compiling our list of preliminary designs and after a&nbsp;rigorous process of elimination
            we landed on three designs that best suited our archtypal person and we could move forward.<br><br>The next step was to futher solidify these concepts so that the entire team was on the same page and we used brainwriting 6-3-5 to help accomplish
            this. Then we each developed a storyboard to help visualise the issue we were trying to solve and how the concepts fit into the space.<br><br><br></p>
