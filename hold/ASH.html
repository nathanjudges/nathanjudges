            After focusing on how autonomy could best help those most affected by DV we came up with a concept that combined a mobile app with an in-car interface that would provide the user with the skills and resources they needed to gain access to
            help and most importantly protect them and their anonymity.<br><br><br></p>
        <p class="text-justify sentences" id="project-sentence-2">After deciding on a problem space we began our first hand research by triangualing the major stakeholders within this topic; Police, Housing Officials and Social Workers. The aim of our research was to&nbsp;determine the major issues within the
            systems set-up to improve the lives of DV sufferers, in both the government and private sectors. In doing this we hoped to learn about the major pain points within this process and assess where we could be most effective in designing a component
            of the solution.<br><br>We utilised; Open-Ended Interviews, Contextual Mapping and Analysis when ingaging with particpants in their place of work. I interviewed police officers and detectives that are heavily involved in the DV unit and the
            Sergeant in charge of the unit.<br><br>Once this data was collected and synthesised the team began amalgamating all the knowledge we had gained and began to form a deeper understanding of the space.<br><br></p>

            we landed on three designs that best suited our archtypal person and we could move forward.<br><br>The next step was to futher solidify these concepts so that the entire team was on the same page and we used brainwriting 6-3-5 to help accomplish

            tested paper prototypes with participants representative of our personas, recording their comments and actions to analysis and help improve our designs. From our initial testes we extrapolated from the results that the most useable and useful
            design was the "Autonomous Secure Housing" design and so we decided to develope it further.<br><br>Taking our initial hand-drawn wireframes and developing all the necassary screens in both the mobile and in-car interface, we then tested, iterated,

            transitions for any design. The process was time consuming compared to using Invision or similar products, but it allowed us to personalise our design and provided us with a lot more freedom.<br><br>Once we had built the majority of this prototype

        <p class="text-justify sentences" id="project-sentence">The final concept for the Autonomous Secure Housing (ASH) system is a mobile app that allows users to order an autonomous bus to a set location at anytime, removing them from a dangerous situation at home. The app contains a "HIDDEN MODE" that
            instantly changes the screen to a simple game until a code is entered to protect their privacy.<br><br>The in-car component of the project was focused on making the user feel as comfortable as possible in this new environment. We achieved
            this by providing constant feedback about where the bus was in relation to geography and it's immedeate surroundings. The interface utilises window pop-ups that lay over the main screen to provide common controls and theses screens can be
            expanded to provide more control if desired. The design also contains information on processes that can be used to protect the user in future scemnarios and also contact details of services they can contact to ask for more help.<br><br><br></p>
