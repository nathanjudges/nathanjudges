      <h2><small>Contextual Research</small></h2>
      <p>The Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA) is a museum dedicated to making contemporary art and ideas accessible to a range of audiences through a presentation of diverse exhibitions and special events.
        To understand this space and design an experience for it - we undertook a variety of design techniques to learn more about it’s visitors and what they expect from a social outing.
        <br></br>
        We began by mapping the space by following patron through the space and analysing how they utilised it, we wanted to understand the natural flow of the area and how the spatial and visual aspects of the museum affected foot traffic.
        Our group analysed both individuals and groups to understand if the was a difference in the way they moved through the exhibition.
      </p><br></br>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
      <img class="smallerImages" src="assets/tagmca/Group Shadowing.JPG"></img>
      </div>

      <br></br><p>This mapping of the space combined with our own critical analysis of the individual aspects from both inside and outside the area produced some valuable insights about who uses the space and how they do so.
        The openness of the layout coupled with the surrounding neighborhood hood of Sydney Harbour allows visitors to direct their own journey - it is very self-exploratory.<br></br>
        Our initial interviews with the museum staff about the gallery gave insight into the behaviors of  patrons: most who visit the gallery only do so once and then rarely return. To empathise with the personal and social contexts of these <em>single-visit</em> users we designed a generative research project aimed at mapping out why people went to the art gallery, or rather - why go on an outing at all?
      </p><br></br>

      <h2><small>User Research</small></h2>
      <p>Once our contextual research had informed us of the climate that surrounded the MCA we began user research, aiming to gather participants from a variety of backgrounds and familiarity with the site.
        We attracted 8 users ranging in ages from 22 - 35 and from a variety of contexts; students, parents, artists and international visitors and gave them each sensitising booklets to complete over the course of a week.
        <br></br>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="smallerImages" src="assets/tagmca/tagmca_12.PNG">
        </div>

        <br></br>
        <p>We are used an A6 booklet with 5 days worth of exercises that are approximately 10mins long. The tasks focus on getting the user to get used to thinking about the positive and negative aspects of group events and how they would differ doing them as an individual. Considering the past and present activities they do, how and why they’ve changed and what they wish they were doing. Reflecting on their feelings towards these occasions to uncover the tacit knowledge related to these ideas, that would initially be difficult for people to describe without priming.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>The sensitising booklet questions were themed around group activities and the notion of a shared experience. This is to help reveal the participants likes and dislikes regarding a variety of social occasions. This will help to amalgamate the best ideas and introduce them to our MCA project, whilst also highlighting ideas to avoid.</p>

      </ul>

      <h2><small style="color:#bbbbbb;">Insights</small></h2>
      <p>Domestic Violence has directly affected 39% of the population (ABS, 2018), but indirectly it affects everyone, doing
          increasing damage to our society & costing billions each year
          (White Ribbon, 2017). This issue ‘doesn’t have a face/demographic', it is anyone and everyone in the Australian popula- $ tion “men, women, children from 20 to 80 years old, people
          with and without money and from any ethnicity. Currently the police are doing their best to deal with these incidents but have limited resources and time.</p>

          </div>

          <h2><small>Ideation</small></h2>
          <p>We used our research to map out the actors in our domain and make sense of where their needs crossed, where technologies were used successfully and where they lacked proper implementation. This began our brainstorming of ideas for a solution; we quickly became frustrated with our early concepts. The complexity lead us to solutions that were either too narrow or broad, after walking through them with our personas we were unsatisfied with their originality.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>We were employing a top down method of generation - using a swathe of data to come to a few solutions. To overcome this creative stagnation we decided to flip our approach, researching and selecting two design methods to generate multiple light concepts that we could then analyse and distill into novel approaches (Tomitsch, 2017). </p>
  

          <div class="col-sm-3">
          <h2><small style="color:#bbbbbb;">Forced Assosciation</small></h2>
          <p>As a team we agreed upon the stakeholders to create a set of cards for (Police, Refuges, Courts etc) and then individually created twenty - thirty vehicle cards (Bus, Bike, Cart etc) as laid out by Tomitsch et. al (2017). We combined this with lecturer Stephanie Grace’s problem statement method to each create more than twenty concept statements and sketches to analyse.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-3">
          <h2><small style="color:#bbbbbb;">Brain writing 6-3-5</small></h2>
          <p>Each member had a piece of paper folded into sections with the chosen solutions at the top. Using a timer - we each wrote a feature, use case or scenario on each square and then rotated the sheets on the buzz, reflecting and then building upon each others ideas. Once complete, we discussed the methods outcomes. Initially we had hoped to come out with two concepts to pursue, but the almost went too well.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-3">
          <h2><small style="color:#bbbbbb;">Storyboarding</small></h2>
          <p>Once the ideas had been generated and refined we then went on to storyboard each idea individually and then re-groud to ensure we were all on the same page with the concepts. A short sketch was created (6 Frames) of each of the 3 concpets explaing the core processes and elements involved in implememnting the solution.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <h2><small>User Testing</small></h2>
          <p>The next step was to create paper prototypes of the interfaces for each of the concepts and get them into the hands of our users (based off personas). We conducted multiple user test with each interface, recording them to analyse later. We found that one of our concepts was clear leader as it was far easier for the participants to understand and so we decided to continue refining this design with furtehr iterations.</p>

          <div class="row">
              <h2><small>Iteration</small></h2>
              <p>Once the user testing was completeed we wen back over our designs and began working on improving the mahor pain points thatwere discovered and included more features we found necassary to make this a successful design.
                Our aim was to focus on solving these issues:
                <br></br>
                <ul  style="color:#bbbbbb;">
                  <li>- Women do not leave dangerous situations for a myriad of reasons</li><br></br>
                  <li>- Even if they did want to leave - there could be nowhere to go</li><br></br>
                  <li>- Victims do not have access to resources</li><br></br>
                  <li>- Police may not be the best first responder to domestic violence</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                So we moved through a variety of iterations and design, performing more rounds of user testing to ensure we were remaining on track with our targets.

        <p>After focusing on how autonomy could best help those most affected by DV we came up with a concept that combined a mobile app with an in-car interface that would provide the user with the skills and resources they needed to gain access to help and most importantly protect them and their anonymity.</p>
